The summarization is done from a population sample utilising several factors such as mean and standard deviation. Descriptive statistics is a way of organising, representing, and explaining a set of data using charts, graphs, and summary measures. Histograms, pie charts, bars, and scatter plots are common ways to summarise data and present it in tables or graphs.\n",

We utilise inferential statistics to convey the meaning of the collected data after it has been collected, evaluated, and summarised. Inferential statistics are used to derive conclusions and inferences from samples, i.e. to create accurate generalisations.\n",

    "\n",
    "1. Nominal Level: At the nominal level of measurement, data are categorized into distinct groups or categories. The values assigned to the data are labels or names that do not possess any inherent order or numerical value. Examples:\n",
    "\n",
    "   - Gender (categories: male, female)\n",
    "   - Eye color (categories: blue, brown, green)\n",
    "   - Marital status (categories: single, married, divorced)\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Ordinal Level: At the ordinal level of measurement, data can be ranked or ordered, but the differences between the categories may not be equal or measurable. The values represent a relative position or ranking. Examples:\n",
    "\n",
    "   - Education(categories: high school, bachelor's degree, master's degree)\n",
    "   - Rating scales (categories: strongly agree, agree, neutral, disagree, strongly disagree)\n",
    "   - Economic status (categories: low income, middle income, high income)\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Interval Level: At the interval level of measurement, data are measured on a scale with equal intervals between the values. The values represent both relative order and equal differences between categories, but there is no true zero point. Examples:\n",
    "\n",
    "   - Temperature measured in Celsius or Fahrenheit\n",
    "   - Years (e.g., 2000, 2005, 2010)\n",
    "   - IQ scores (e.g., 100, 120, 140)\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Ratio Level: At the ratio level of measurement, data are measured on a scale with equal intervals between the values and a true zero point. The values possess all the properties of the interval level but also allow for the calculation of ratios and meaningful comparisons. Examples:\n",

    "   - Height (e.g., 150 cm, 180 cm)\n",
